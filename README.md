## Introduction
I am interested in networking field since it has something to do with my daily job too. So, here I would like to take a step to learn more about networking. I have already studied Mikrotik basics but I found that CCNA is more detailed. The difference thing is that it also discuss the VLAN and also it has Cisco packet tracer in which it has more detailed simulation on networking compared to GNS3. That is what I thought, so lets go.
