# Setting up for AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate Course

## Cloud Research

- Set up separate master and production accounts in AWS to 'containerise' the course project
- Applied a trick when registering with my gmail account, resulting in an infinite number of email addresses available (take `myname@gmail.com` - adding a plus sign is ignored by gmail, but not by the website you're registering with, so `myname+secondaccount@gmail.com` gets redirected to your original email address)
- Created billing alerts and MFA for root and IAM users in master and production accounts
- Created access keys and added them to AWS credential files on local machine
