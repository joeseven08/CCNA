## My Summarised Experience

- I took the exam in a local PSI test centre
- They provided earplugs :heart: and scratch/scrap paper
- It was hard - the grammar and vocabulary were very different to the materials I'd practiced with - and I thought there was a good chance of failure.
- It took 45 mins to complete
