# Cloud Resume Challenge - Route 53 & Certificate Manager

## Cloud Research

- Bought a custom domain name for my CV, and created a new S3 bucket to match the domain name (you can't modify S3 bucket names), as it loads the correct bucket name into options if you do...
- Tried configuring CloudFront, but it won't enable HTTPS without a certificate
- Waiting for an email to validate the certificate for use in the CloudFront distribution. This could take a day or so, as the domain name is new too
- AWS documentation was far too verbose and complicated. AWS console UI keeps changing, rendering video guides useless. I found [this](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/simple-site-hosting-with-amazon-s3-and-https-5e78017f482a/) much more helpful!
