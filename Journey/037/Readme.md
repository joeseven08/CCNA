# DevOps - The Introduction Course: 2

## Chef - Deployment Models: Server-Client & Chef Zero

Server Client - production

- Think of this as being like a restaurant where the chef (host machine)delivers different requests to different customers (nodes)
- Pull-based mechanism
- Chef server can only be Linux; client/node can be other OS

Chef Zero - production cookbooks, testing, proof of concept

- aka self-contained server
- Acts as server and client on a single host
- Think of it like a test kitchen

### Cloud Research

- Chef is a Ruby-based, system-automation-friendly, IT automation tool used to configure, manage, deploy and orchestrate various applications and services across your entire infrastructure
- Comes with two deployment models
  - Chef-Zero (lighter model for dev, testing, proof of concept)
  - Server-Client
- OS
  - Chef Server - Linux only
  - Chef Client - Linux and Windows
- Chef uses a declarative programming approach
- Consistent delivery
- Highly scalable
- Increased productivity
- Simplicity
