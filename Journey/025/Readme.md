# Discover Chaos Engineering - A Talk :monkey:

## Introduction

WWCode Cloud hosted a talk by Jennifer Bergstrom on Chaos Engineering

## Use Case

- It tests on your operating system while it's in PRODUCTION

## Notes

- Failure testing used to be a thought experiment; heavy on hypotheticals, light on actual testing
- 2010: AWS invent Chaos Monkey. It randomly takes down servers. Created for Netflix.
- 2014: Netflix creates the Chaos Engineer role. Chaos Engineers perform failure injection testing in the production system, during business hours
- The Simian Army has expanded. e.g. Chaos Kong, Chaos Gorilla, Compliance Monkey, etc
- Now, chaos engineering is a widely accepted form of testing. A lot of unicorns use it, but smaller companies do too.
- Chaos engineering allows you to move from post-mortem failure analysis to pre-mortem failure experiments
- It is a hands-on eduational tool
- It can be used to enforce compliance in Production
- Strict compliance without gatekeepers
- Gremlin exists as Chaos as a Service (CaaS?). It is licenced (so it is a paid service), but it is also tried and tested
