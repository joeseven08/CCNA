# It's The Final Countdown!

## Cloud Research

- 95% on the final test in the mock exams!
- Got 100% in all sections except Technology (90%)
- Based on the above, revised which services are global, retook the Technology section test, and looked at short descriptions of each pillar in the Well Architected Framework. I tripped up on a partial description on one of the pillars. Compare: "selecting the right resource types and sizes based on workload requirements" (Performance Efficiency) with "selecting the most appropriate and right number of resource types" (Cost Optimisation). I guess the word to look out for is "workload"...
