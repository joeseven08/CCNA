# Switch Interfaces
## Network Topology

For this lesson, we use layer 2 switch. No IP asssigned to the switch.

Here is the status in the switch of layer 2. The status is up and up because there is a device connected while down and down because there is no interface connected to the switch. There is no need to make the switch up.

- Duplex refers to how data is transmitted and received over a network link. It determines whether communication between two network devices happens in one direction at a time or both directions simultaneously.
1. Half Duplex

Data can only travel in one direction at a time.

Similar to a walkie-talkie: either you talk, or you listen â€” not both at once.

Characteristics:

- Older technology, common in hubs and very old switches.
- More collisions can occur since only one device can send data at a time.
- Lower performance than full duplex.

2. Full Duplex

Data can travel in both directions simultaneously.

Like a phone call: you can speak and listen at the same time.

Characteristics:

- Higher performance.
- No collisions because both devices have a dedicated send and receive path.
- Standard for modern Ethernet networks.

3. Auto (Default)

The switch negotiates the best duplex setting automatically with the connected device using Auto-Negotiation.

Best option if both devices support it.

Potential issue:

If one side is set to auto and the other side is set manually to full or half, a duplex mismatch can occur, leading to:

- Slow performance
- High error counts (like CRC errors or collisions)

Collision will occur if:
