# Pipelines - DevOps class

## Introduction

Today we're taking a remote class on Twitch with Aaron Brooks of Mastermnd Audio

## Prerequisite

- None. This is pretty high level

## Use Case

- Class is designed for newbies to DevOps. As the second class it's pretty high level, so we understand what we're getting into!

## Cloud Research

- Primary Roles - DevOps

## Primary Roles in DevOps

#### Documenting "tribal" knowledge

The type of knowledge you have when you're part of an org. The people there know how these things work - only known among the "tribe" and not written down. Info is scattered among individuals, and goes when they leave the org. DevOps is about documenting these processes so knowledge can be shared! It is very difficult to do, and usually the first thing to be neglected in the heat of making an app. "Document like you're leaving in two weeks."

#### CI/CD management and automation

As DevOps you're the arbiter of pipelines and processes - and what most people associate with the title. This means using tools such as Jenkins, Circle CI, Bamboo, GitHub Actions...

#### Developer Support

Building ways for developers to deliver code faster. Your job is to find out what developers need, and making sure those things can happen. Think of them as your customer.

#### Process Automation

Not just the automation of development processes, this is automating _any_ process that helps the team, org, etc move faster and deliver software as fast as they want to. You're trying to take anything that happens over and over again and make sure it is set up in such a way, with the least amount of human interaction possible.

#### Infrastructure Management

There's overlap with SRE, but as DevOps your focus is on delivery of the software. A lot of jobs will make you responsible for production delivery, making sure those systems are reliable... BUT - it's possible for your job to stop at software delivery.

#### Performance Assessment

Making sure that the apps you're running are working in the way that's intended / up to standard. Think of the DevOps Observability pillar.

#### Monitoring

Use this to help make performance assessments

#### Collaborators

To understand what the developers/business needs are, so you can enact the right solutions.

Not a role where you are taking orders on what to do. Instead, it's a collaborative, conversational role where you're doing your best to understand needs and value of products before implementing them.

## Primary Roles - SRE

"SRE implements DevOps"

## Money

Median salary ranges in the US (for all infrastructure roles, hence wide ranges)

Entry - Entry-Mid -> 60k - 95k
Entry-Mid - Mid-Senior -> 95k - 150k
Mid-Senior - ??? -> 120k?

These salaries are high. Beware of Imposter Syndrome.
Aaron predicts more apprenticeships as the need for DevOps folks keeps increasing.

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

There's lots of overlap between DevOps and SRE roles. But remember that at least officially, DevOps is about development and SRE is about systems. DevOps is more Configuration as Code than pure programming.

## Next Steps

Next week is all about Linux
