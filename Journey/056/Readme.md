## Cloud Research

- Primary Roles - DevOps

## Primary Roles in DevOps

#### Documenting "tribal" knowledge

The type of knowledge you have when you're part of an org. The people there know how these things work - only known among the "tribe" and not written down. Info is scattered among individuals, and goes when they leave the org. DevOps is about documenting these processes so knowledge can be shared! It is very difficult to do, and usually the first thing to be neglected in the heat of making an app. "Document like you're leaving in two weeks"

#### CI/CD management and automation

As DevOps you're the arbiter of pipelines and processes - and what most people associate with the title. This means using tools such as Jenkins, Circle CI, Bamboo, GitHub Actions...

#### Developer Support

Building ways for people to deliver code faster. Your job is to find out what developers need, and making sure those things can happen.

#### Process Automation

#### Infrastructure Management

You're responsible for dev delivery, but also servers

#### Performance Assessment

Making sure that the apps you're running are working in the way that's intended.

#### Monitoring

Use this to help make performance assessments

#### Collaborators

Not taking orders on what to do. Instead, you're doing your best to understand needs and value of products.
