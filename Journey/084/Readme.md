# Back with a Job and a New AWS Cert to Study For!

## Cloud Research

Apologies for the haitus, I was job hunting, then I was chilling, then I was onboarding, and _now_ I'm 'on the bench', waiting for my background check to clear, while they pay for me to get my AWS Solutions Archictect Associate cert!!! 

Grabbed a course and some practice exams this afternoon. So far it's orientation and setup, so nothing to report today except that I'm LIVING THE DREAM!
