No time to really read around/google the subject while doing the lab. It takes some time to set up and tear down the cluster and I don't think that's been factored into the time allowed...

- Set a default compute zone
- Created a GKE cluster
- Got authentication credential for the cluster
- Deployed an application to the cluster
