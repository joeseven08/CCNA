# What's All This About 85% Then??

## Introduction

If you've been following along, you may have noticed the fact I'm reporting my AWS CCP mock exam scores. And they're not bad, right? You only need a score of 70% to pass the Certified Cloud Practitioner exam.

## Here's the thing:

The practice exam questions provided by AWS are much easier than the real exam. It costs around \$100 (plus tax) to take and I have very little practical experience anyway, so I need to pass on the first try. I found a great little community called [AWS Certifications](https://www.reddit.com/r/awscertifications), and from courses to exam providers it's been extremely useful in making well-informed choices on a limited budget. The Udemy course was a fantastic introduction to AWS (and took away the feeling of being overwhelmed), but it was reading the white papers and taking the 3rd party mock exams that made things really stick.

The advice given time and again is that when you _consistently_ score >= 85% on these mock exams, you are _guaranteed_ to pass the CCP. This week I'm aiming to get a run on all five, plus the final exam before going for it.

## Cloud Research

- 95% on the retake of Set 1!
- Attended a series of AWS webinars this morning, called **Developers, Let's Build**. The slide linked above was from a lecture featuring the SAM CLI, which I'm required to use as part of the Cloud Resume Challenge and it was great to see it in action. Glad to see that people are still checking whether things are hotdogs or not.
- Finished functionality and about 95% of the design of my cloud resume, which is just as good, as I can't stop tinkering with it! Putting it away until I've taken the CCP.
