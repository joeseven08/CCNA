# Thoughtworks, Kief Morris, and IaC

Today I attended a talk by Thoughtworks, which was an interview/ Q&A session with Kief Morris, author of 'Infrastructure as Code', now in its 2nd edition.

## Cloud Research

- First edition came out 4 years ago. In this edition, Keif notes that it's no longer about convincing people to use these tools, but to show good practices
- Originally wrote the book because he was sending people to the same articles for advice
- "IaC unlocked a lot of things weâ€™ve been doing in software eng for ages"
- What's 'mocking' and 'stubbing' in IaC?
- Do everything as code! e.g. API Gateway (ahem)
- Reliability, repeatability, consistency
