# Hoist: Terraform Tutorial Pt 1

## Introduction

Terraform is on my Tech Returners course, and I've just found [this](https://youtu.be/82gMxNob3Uc) introduction to it via Aaron Brooks of Mastermnd!

"Terraform" - to change the environment of a planet so that it is more like another planet; in sci-fi this usually means making it habitable for humans - like Earth.

"Hashicorp Terraform is a tool for building, changing and versioning infrastructure safely and efficiently. It can manage existing and popular service providers as well as custom in-house solutions."

We're using it in a cloud space, but it operates on other levels too. The reason why Terraform is so popular is because it's so flexible in terms of what it can be integrated with.

## Prerequisite

This shouldn't be hard if you've had prior experience with Infrastructure as Code... Did Aaron just say Terraform was like AWS CloudFormation?

## Use Case

DevOps, SREs, Cloud, Systems and Software Engineers might use Terraform in their jobs.

## Cloud Research

- Infrastructure as Code

### Infrastructure as Code

This is much bigger than Terraform - IaC is driving much of the automation you can do today.

- IaC is the process of managing and provisioning data centres through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.
