# Introducing The Cloud Resume Challenge!

## Introduction

I want to put into practice what I'd learned while revising for the AWS CCP exam, as well as showcasing other tech skills. Someone recommended Forrest Brazeal's [Cloud Resume Challenge](https://forrestbrazeal.com/2020/04/23/the-cloud-resume-challenge/), and although the deadline has long since passed, the actual project is totally worth it. At the moment my priority is to pass the CCP comfortably (and I need to reference the cert in this resume anyway) and move into learning DevOps skills, so for now this will be a part-time project.

## Use Case

- Hosts my resume in the Cloud for potential employers
- Utilises skills learned as a full-stack engineer
- > I believe that if you can, in good faith, complete the Cloud Resume Challenge, you will already have more useful skills than a lot of people who graduate from university computer science programs. Specifically: you will understand something about full-stack software development, version control, infrastructure as code, automation, continuous integration and delivery, cloud services and “serverless”, application security, and networking.

## Cloud Research

- Designed a cloud architecture as I currently understand it
- Reacquainted myself with HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, and started building out
- Started a Trello board, splitting the challenge up into three distinct phases:

1. Create HTML resume
2. Deploy HTML resume on AWS
3. CI/CD

- In other news, I scored 75.38% on Tutorials Dojo timed mode - set 4
- 98.46% on the retake
- 90% on review mode - set 3
