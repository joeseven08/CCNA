# Creating an EKS cluster with AWS, Terraform and Kubernetes

## Cloud Research

- Created a EKS cluster with AWS, Terraform and Kubernetes (and Dinner & DevOps with Tech Returners) in the terminal

- Logged into AWS console with my dedicated terraform IAM identity to watch it form there too

- Testing the connection to the cluster with `kubectl get nodes` gave the error `The connection to the server localhost:8080 was refused - did you specify the right host or port?`

- I didn't have time to fix the problem and instead, destroyed the cluster with `terraform destroy`

- It's good to get things configured and working but I need a much deeper dive to completely understand what's going on!
