# Hoist: Terraform Tutorial Pt 3

## Introduction

Pushing on with Mastermndio's free Terrform course!

## Prerequisite

- It would help if you did the previous classes

## Use Case

- üñºÔ∏è (Show-Me) Create an graphic or diagram that illustrate the use-case of how this knowledge could be applied to real-world project
- ‚úçÔ∏è (Show-Me) Explain in one or two sentences the use case

## Cloud Research

- Input Variables
- Modules
- Output Variables
- Understanding State
- Practice!

### Input Variables

HCL allows you to use variables for making dynamic configurations

These variables can be used to specify values for parameters and args that may change, depending on how you're using the config. They can be placed in files with these formats:

- variables.tf
- terraform.tfvars
- terraform.tfvars.json
  Then you reference the variables contained within, in your main config file

Environment variables are prefixed with `TF_VAR_`

We declare variables like a resources in our configuration

## Try yourself

We're going to have a play with variables and how they integrate with the Terraform
