# IaC & Networking

Sorry about these intermittent breaks. My current client assignment involves me attending meetings for most of the working day, and I am strongly encouraged to study in my "spare time". After 8 hours in front of a computer, I tend to want to do anything else than sit in front of a computer... Ocassionally, like today, I get a moment to myself and can get stuck in.

VPCs and Networking in the AWS-SAA course have been way out of my comfort zone, so rather than learning the minimum to pass the exam, I took advantage of Udemy's sale and bought 15 hour courses on networking and security, respectively. 

My employer has an O'Reilly account, and they have the latest edition of _Infrastructure as Code_ by Kief Morris, so I'll be leafing through that too. Both of these resources highly applicable to our current client project, where we're about to inherit a system where there is no IaC in place, a single VPC, and very little in the way of security and compliance...

## Cloud Research

**Networking**
- Intro to the course 
- Basics - overview and benefits of computer networks

**IaC**
- _Preface_
It's fascinating to see how fast things have changed since the release of the first edition of this book five years ago - the emphasis being on making the business case for and managing IaC. Now that cloud has been largely adopted, this edition seems to be focussed on building IaC stacks.
