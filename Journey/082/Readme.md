# CI/CD with Travis CI & AWS

## Introduction

Today's lesson concludes yesterday's React/Docker project. We'll connect GitHub, Travis CI and AWS to complete the workflow.

## Prerequisite

- GitHub account
- AWS account
- React/Docker project from yesterday

## Use Case

Completing a CI/CD workflow. Deploying a containerised React app to the cloud with automation.

## Cloud Research

- Tradionally, people use Travis CI for testing or deployment, we're going to use it for both.
- AWS Elastic Beanstalk is the easiest way to get started with production Docker instances, when running a single container.
- The user's request to our React app will be handled by a load balancer that as already been created as a part of the Elastic Beanstalk application. When a request comes into it the load balancer will route that request to a virtual machine that is running Docker (with our application inside of it).
- Elastic Beanstalk monitors the amount of traffic coming in to our virtual machine. As soon as that traffic reaches a certain threshold Elastic Beanstalk will scale out and add more virtual machines to handle that traffic.

## Try yourself

Let's hook it all up!

### Step 1 ‚Äî Push project folder to GitHub repo

- Create a new repo on Github
  - Give it a name
  - Make it public
  - Don't initialise with a Readme
  - Click `create repository`
  - Grab the link to the repo
- Connect local repo to Github
  - `git remote add origin {link to repo}`
  - `git branch -M main`
  - `git push -u origin main`

### Step 2 ‚Äî Travis CI setup

- Sign up for an account at `https://travis-ci.org/`
- Choose GitHub or email
- Go into settings to authorise Travis CI access to the repo we added in the last step. In the dashboard we'll see that there are no builds just yet

Now we need to create a YAML file. For now, we'll focus on getting our tests to run on Travis

- In the project root file, create `.travis.yml`

![travis.yml](/Journey/082/travis-file.png)

- `sudo: required` - any time we make use of Docker we need to have super user permissions

- `before_install` - things that need to be executed before our tests are run

- `script` contains all the commands that need to be executed to actually run our test suite

The default run command `npm run test` hangs there and never exits. To get it to run the tests and then exit back to the command line add `-- --coverage`

- Push this to GitHub
- Check in TravisCI dashboard

### Step 3 ‚Äî Create Elastic Beanstalk instance in AWS

Log into AWS console. Navigate to Elastic Beanstalk.

- Click `create application`
- Give it a name
- Set up the platform like this. If you go for Amazon Linux 2 it will look to build from `docker-compose` so don't select this!

![platform options](/Journey/082/platform.png)

- Leave application code options for now

![application code options](/Journey/082/application-code.png)

- Click `create application`

This will take a few minutes - time to make a cup of tea. ‚òïÔ∏è

Here it is!

...and here's the boilerplate page that comes with th EBS instance

### Step 4 ‚Äî Configure Travis CI for deployment

Add this deployment code to the `.travis.yml` file

![travis deploy](/Journey/082/travis-deploy.png)

- `bucket_name` - Elastic Beanstalk has automatically created an S3 bucket, so navigate to the S3 page and locate it

- `bucket_path` - this won't be set until the first deployment, so the default is to give it the same name as `app`

At this point of the lesson, we're given the notice that Travis-ci.org is becoming .com and to follow instructions to migrate our account...

### Step 5 ‚Äî Create and store access keys

- In AWS, create a new IAM user with programmatic access only, with full permissions for Elastic Beanstalk

- In the settings for the repo in Travis, plug them into the environment variables section:

![AWS keys in Travis](/Journey/082/AWS-keys.png)

- Connect it to the travis.yml file like so:

![link to keys in Travis](/Journey/082/correctly-formatted-aws.png)

### Step 6 ‚Äî Expose ports through the Dockerfile

- Add the instruction `EXPOSE 80` to the `Dockerfile`:

![config](/Journey/082/expose-80.png)

In the EBS console:
![pending](/Journey/082/docker-aws.png)

This is taking some time and it's pancake day, so now's a good time to get those pancakes in! ü•û

TADA! üéâ

### Step 7 ‚Äî Test the workflow

- Create new feature branch in the project repo, and make a change in /src/App.js
- Add, commit and push to the new feature branch on GitHub
- In GitHub, create a pull request (notice TravisCI runs checks on the code)
- Merge the PR
- Navigate to the Travis console to see the workflow being run
- Be patient, go to the EBS dashboard and when it's been deployed...
- Refresh the EBS bucket url

### Step 8 - Environment cleanup

- Go to the Elastic Beanstalk dashboard
- Click into the application
- Click `actions` > `delete application`

#### ‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Outcome

Lots of debugging connecting the AWS keys in the `.travis.yml`. The course taught putting quotes around it, which was incorrect syntax, and Travis CI's documentation was unclear. In the end I looked at the course's source code, which was completely different to what was taught in the videos!!!! Yet again, feeling grateful that I was already familiar with AWS and workflows...

## Next Steps

Next, I'm going to prepare for upcoming job interviews, but after that I'll return to build a multi-container application!
