# DevOps - The Lightning Talk

## Cloud Research

- I can see which way the wind is blowing - the more we adopt DevOps tools, the more we'll get asked about it. So today I've made a load of [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1jMUuw4t2rUiucktPLQ5MTO_n2hwE2ZytU_9l3nWaIh8/edit?usp=sharing) for a 10 min lightning talk, which with any luck, they'll allow me to give on Monday.
