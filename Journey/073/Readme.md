# Linux Basic Navigation (LUC 2), Creating a VM in GCP

## Cloud Research

- Emphasis on the fact that Linux sysadmins spend much of their time at the command-line, so get comfortable using it
- Most of this was revision for me
- To get the manual for a specific command, run `man <command>`
- `cd -` moves you into the last visited directory
- GCP are offering free cloud training for a month via Qwicklabs, so as today's revision was over so quickly I learned how to create and deploy Google Compute Engine virtual machine!
