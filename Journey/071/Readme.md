# Docker and Kubernetes - Intro

## Introduction

I originally planned to read about components in the docs, but it was pretty verbose and I'm a hands-on learner, so I decided to do a tutorial or two, to put these concepts in context. To be honest, I think I need to know Docker better, and it just so happens that I have a highly recommended Docker and Kubernetes Udemy course gathering dust in my account.

## Prerequisite

- Comfortable on the command line
- Some knowledge of operating systems?

## Use Case

- Deepening my knowledge of Docker so I can learn K8s in context
- Containers and orchestration

## Cloud Research

- Set up Docker for Mac (already have)
- A container is a process (or a set of processes) that has a grouping of resources specifically assigned to it.

- We've got some running process (e.g. Chrome) that sends a system call to a kernel, the kernel looks at the incoming system call and direct it to a very specific portion of the hard drive, RAM, CPU etc. A portion of each of these resources is made available to that singular process

- An _image_ is a file system snapshot. Also contains a startup command e.g. `run chrome`

- Docker Desktop is a Linux VM

- `docker version` displays the name of this Linux VM...

## ☁️ Cloud Outcome

Understood containers and Docker more deeply

## Next Steps

Docker CLI commands
